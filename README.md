# Microprocessor Systems

Introduces small microprocessor-based systems, with an emphasis on embedded system hardware and software design. Topics will include microprocessor architecture and structure, with an overview of 8- 16- and 32-bit systems, assembly language programming and the use of high-level languages. Basic input/output including parallel communications with and without handshaking and serial protocols. Hardware and software timing. Using interrupts and exceptions. Overview of single-chip microprocessors and controllers with an emphasis on the Freescale HCS12. The internal structure and design of peripheral devices. Memory system design and analysis. The use and structure of development tools such as (cross) assemblers or compilers, monitor programs, simulators, emulators, etc.

# Project (Eebot robot) Overview
To program the eebot mobile robot with a navigation system that can find its way through a maze, reverse, and back its way out again. A possible variation on this is that the robot first learns the maze. Then it is started again at the beginning and should navigate the maze without errors.

# Key Objectives
1. Use technical knowledge on microprocessor architecture, I/O interface and peripherals, assembly/C language programming and debugging methodology. Use design tools and related resources, microprocessor peripherals, assemblers,     
   compilers, and monitor programs.
2. Learn good practices in structuring a microprocessor control program. Apply the programming principles, including top-down programming, bottom-up programming, and functional programming to define an accurate programming problem 
   statement. Recognize that good problem definition assists the program design process. Describe differences between the various approaches to solving a programming problem using assembly/C language. Select one specific approach. 
   When it fails, analyze the cause of failure using standard programming and debugging methodologies. Based on the analysis, improve the existing approach. Integrate the new suggestions into the existing design plan. Judge the 
   completeness and quality of the generated solutions.
3. Describe the iterative process of programming/debugging assembly/C programs. Use debugging tools to generate information on the current state of a program. Use it to modify/improve the solution as needed. Incorporate and integrate 
   feedback from the instructors and generate new knowledge about the programming problem.
4. Manages own time and processes effectively to achieve personal and team goals - Assessment of laboratory and project assignments on the correctness and quality of design, decomposing project into key tasks, managing 
   project to meet timeline, code quality, language and technical quality
5. Produce lab and project reports using appropriate format, grammar, and citation styles for technical and non-technical audiences.
6. Illustrate concepts including the structure of assembly/C language programs and obtained experimental results.
7. Understanding and establishment of project scope - Planning tasks, allocating responsibilities, and setting timelines to meet project goals - Identifying assumptions that may affect project success - Communicating key project   
   deliverables in a clear, concise manner - Displaying a basic understanding of the issues in managing the implementation of the project - Understanding task inter-relationships and managing projects accordingly to time deadlines - 
   Allocating tasks to team members and coordinating dynamically as problems or opportunities emerge.
